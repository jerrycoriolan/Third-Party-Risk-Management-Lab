Practical Assessment: Third-Party Risk Management

I have been tasked with conducting a security assessment on a supplier. I sent the supplier a TPRM questionnaire, and I have received answers.

High-risk items:
-	The vendor does not have a cybersecurity team or a proper cybersecurity capability. Although the IT team manages cybersecurity, no framework is followed. This vendor does not have sufficient cybersecurity capability, which poses a high risk to our organization. 

-	The vendor does not have a vulnerability management or penetration testing program. 

-	Lack of cybersecurity detection and monitoring capability. 

-	The vendor is not capable of responding to cybersecurity incidents.

-	The vendor needs to improve its identity and access management.

-	The vendor encrypts data and takes regular backups, but it doesn’t monitor for data loss issues. This medium risk would be high if data was not encrypted or backups were not taken.
